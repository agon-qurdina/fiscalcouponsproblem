# Solving the problem of distibution of fiscal coupons using GRASP algorithm 

When customers buy goods or services from business entities
they are usually given a receipt that is known with the name fiscal or tax
coupon, which, among the others, contains details about the value of the
transaction. In some countries, the fiscal coupons can be collected during a
certain period of time and, at the end of the collection period, they can be
handed over to the tax authorities in exchange for a reward, whose price
depends on the number of collected coupons and the sum of their values. 

From the optimisation perspective, this incentive becomes interesting when, both the
number of coupons and the sum of their value is large. Hence, here is a proposed solution based on
GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) algorithm. The computational
experiments indicate that the proposed solution obtains promising results for
complex problem instances, which show that the proposed algorithm can be
used to solve realistic problems by utilizing standard
personal computers.
